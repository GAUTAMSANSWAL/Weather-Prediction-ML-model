# Weather-Prediction-ML-model
I will train a model to predict weather with machine learning. I will act as if i do not have access to the weather forecast. I have access to a century of historical averages of global temperatures, including global maximum temperatures, global minimum temperatures, and global land and ocean temperatures.
